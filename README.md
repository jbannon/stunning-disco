## Clustering Radiomics Features



This cute lil' repo exists as an example of a way to use community detection on graphs to perform unsupervised clustering of features. 

##### Community Detection on a Bumper Sticker


A *graph* is a collection of objects that are related in pairs. In mathy terms it's a set of *nodes* connected by *edges.* The problem of *community detection* is, as the name suggests, about finding communities in graphs. As an example, consider a graph where the nodes are members of the BHKLab and edges exist between people if they've exchanged messages on Slack (these edges could be weighted to reflect frequency of communication). A community detection task would be to see if you could guess from this data who is in radiomics and who is in pharmacogenomics.
